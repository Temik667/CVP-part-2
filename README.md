## Infant Vision

Our team investigated the effect of low visual acuity and colour sensitivity on learning
performance and speed using ResNET18 and Tiny Imagenet Dataset. The model used SDG with
momentum with early stopping, 10 epochs. The transformation code is taken from Ashna Chalil for
color perception and acuity simulation. To observe the effect of transformations, we trained 4 identical
models with identical parameters, but with different datasets.
